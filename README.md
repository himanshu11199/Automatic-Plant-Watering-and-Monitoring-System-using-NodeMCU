# Automatic-Plant-Watering-and-Monitoring-System-using-NodeMCU
Automation rules the world nowadays. It is a technique of using computers or mobile phones in monitoring and controlling the simple parameters of day-to-day life. The standard of our life will be nourished by the practice of using automa-tion for simple things. IOT provides solutions for various problems and it allows things to be sensed or controlled remotely in network infrastructure. It is possible to control many operations of the field remotely from anywhere, anytime by IOT, in which an individual can control his electronic devices using a smart phone. So, we are going to work on Automatic Plant Watering and Monitoring System using NodeMCU where we will use some sensors like Soil moisture sensor and DHT humidity sensor. It will be real time monitoring system prototype which will help people to monitor the parameters like temperature, humidity and soil moisture etc. and ensures maintenance of the garden by switching on water supply through pump from anywhere, anytime using mobile phone. It offers a futuristic way of life and plays a vital role and serves as a good companion for plants.
